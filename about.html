                <h2>Music Career</h2>
                <p>In March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, a retrospective tour covering all her studio albums. Media outlets extensively covered the tour's cultural and economic impact, and its US leg broke the record for the most tickets sold in a day. Ticketmaster received public and political criticisms for mishandling the tour's ticket sales. The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour in history, collecting over $1 billion. Its concert film, released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, grossed over $250 million to become the highest-grossing concert film, and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement. </p>

                <h2>Cats</h2>
                <p>Taylor Swift is a proud cat mom.

                    The Lover singer's pet family includes three felines — Meredith Grey, Olivia Benson and Benjamin Button — whom she openly adores.
                    
                    Swift has never been shy about making her cats part of her personality, and fans love her all the more for it. All three cats have made multiple appearances on her social media pages and even in some of her music videos. In 2020, the superstar's pets were also featured in her holiday card, wearing cute winter gear against a black-and-white background reminiscent of her 2020 album folklore.</p>

                <h2>Favorite Number</h2>
                <p>Taylor Swift considers number 13 to be her lucky number, often referencing it.

                    Swift stated in an interview, "I was born on the 13th, I turned 13 on Friday the 13th, my first album went gold in 13 weeks. Also, my first song that ever went number 1, it had a 13 second intro, I didn't even do that on purpose! And every time I've ever won an award at an award show, I've either been seated in the 13th row, or row M, which is the 13th letter. And when I won the Horizon Award at the CMA awards, the producer came up to me when I was sound-checking and he said, 'Alright, we're gonna go in 13 seconds!' There are so many numbers!"</p>
